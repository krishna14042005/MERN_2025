        <h3>1. Why there is three dots in if...else and do...while ?</h3>
        <p>The three dots (...) in if...else and do...while in documentation or examples are placeholders used to indicate omitted code or logic. 
            They imply that additional statements or code blocks should be added in those places.</p>

        <h3>2. What is the difference between spread and rest operator ?</h3>
        <p>The spread operator (...) expands an array or object, while the rest operator (...) collects multiple elements into an array or parameters and used as function parameter.</p>

        <h3>3. In for in loop while traversing through an object why the output is undefined when accessing using dot operator ?</h3>
        <p>The output is undefined because obj.key is looking for a property literally named "key" in the object, instead of dynamically accessing the property using the value of the key variable.</p>
